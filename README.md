## kraken-withdrawalfees-in-euros.js
Adds an extra column to the table on [Kraken's withdrawal fee webpage](https://support.kraken.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000767986-Cryptocurrency-withdrawal-fees-and-minimums), containing the withdrawal fees converted to euros (courtesy of CoinGecko), sorting the table on this column as well.

*This script now no longer works, as the fee page was changed somewhere around July 2023. At this moment I don't want to spend time to figure out those changes and try to make the script work again.*
